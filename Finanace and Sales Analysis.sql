### Exploring the Croma India Data
-- a. first grab customer codes for Croma india
	SELECT * FROM dim_customer WHERE customer like "%croma%" AND market="india";

-- b. Get all the sales transaction data from fact_sales_monthly table for that customer(croma: 90002002) in the fiscal_year 2021
	SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
	WHERE 
            customer_code=90002002 AND
            YEAR(DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH))=2021 
	ORDER BY date asc
	LIMIT 100000;

-- c. create a function 'get_fiscal_year' to get fiscal year by passing the date
	CREATE FUNCTION `get_fiscal_year`(calendar_date DATE) 
	RETURNS int
    	DETERMINISTIC
	BEGIN
        	DECLARE fiscal_year INT;
        	SET fiscal_year = YEAR(DATE_ADD(calendar_date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH));
        	RETURN fiscal_year;
	END

-- d. Replacing the function created in the step:b
	SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
	WHERE 
            customer_code=90002002 AND
            get_fiscal_year(date)=2021 
	ORDER BY date asc
	LIMIT 100000;



###  Gross Sales Report: Monthly Product Transactions

-- a. Perform joins to pull product information
	SELECT s.date, s.product_code, p.product, p.variant, s.sold_quantity 
	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN dim_product p
        ON s.product_code=p.product_code

    	    get_fiscal_year(date)=2021     
	LIMIT 1000000;

-- b. Performing join with 'fact_gross_price' table with the above query and generating required fields
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.product_code, 
            p.product, 
            p.variant,
